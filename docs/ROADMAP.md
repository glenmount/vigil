# Vigil — Roadmap (18–24 months)

## North Star
Raise Dignity Minutes (DM%) and reduce burnout—without surveillance. Ship weekly: Live Queue, Weekly Stress Report, and Nudge Receipts with citations.

## Phase 1 (0–30d) — Burnout Empathy Loop + Live Queue
- Build CSV adapters, labels, nudges, receipts; fairness guard; minimal viewer.
- Ship: Top-10 Live Queue; Stress Report (DM%, calls>8m, interruptions/hr, charting mins) with ≤2 citations.
- Gates: byte-identical reruns; equal-risk gap <1.0pp; CI blocks outbound network.

## Phase 2 (31–90d) — Floor Loops & Proofs
- Sterile Cockpit, Break Guarantees, Ambient Docs/Smart Carts.
- Targets: calls>8m −25%; interruptions/hr −30%; charting minutes −40–60% on a wing.
- Gates: ≥90% nudges carry citations; DM% +15% from baseline.

## Phase 3 (90–180d) — Executable Standards & Scale
- Machine-checkable policy rules; Delta Intelligence; optional night-safety mini-pilot (no video/audio).
- Gates: site-wide Live Queue + Monday Stress Report; culture kit deployed.

## Phase 4 (6–12m) — SDK + Multi-site Pilots
- Read-only SDK for receipts/citations; provider portal (read-only); multi-site pilots.
- Gate: external integrator uses SDK.

## Phase 5 (12–24m) — Scale & External Audits
- National roll-outs; third-party audits of receipts; partner portal.
- Gate: open receipts digest; reproducible deltas; audits passed.

## Scoreboard
DM% ↑; calls>8m ↓; interruptions/hr ↓; charting minutes ↓; equal-risk gap <1.0pp; nudge completion & time-to-act; family complaints ↓.

## Cadence & Safety
Four-Day Sprints; “if it’s not in the Queue/Report/Receipt, it doesn’t exist”. Facility-owned exports only; zero PII; privacy rails in CI.
